        <p class="about-text">Welcome to our flower store!
          At Tita's Flower Store, we are passionate about flowers and the joy they bring to people's lives. We believe that every occasion deserves to be celebrated with the beauty of nature, and our mission is to bring happiness and inspiration to our customers through our carefully curated floral arrangements.
        <p class="about-text">Our journey began 1987, when our founder, Tita, realized the lack of high-quality, personalized floral services in the area. With years of experience in the industry and a deep love for all things botanical, she decided to start her own business, committed to providing her clients with exceptional service and beautiful arrangements that exceed expectations.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Since then, Tita's Flower Store has grown into a beloved local business, with a dedicated team of talented florists who share our founder's passion and creativity. We pride ourselves on sourcing the freshest, highest-quality blooms from local growers and reputable suppliers, and using our expertise to design arrangements that perfectly suit each customer's preferences and needs.</p>
        <p class="about-text">We understand that every event, from weddings and anniversaries to birthdays and funerals, is unique and deserves to be treated as such. That's why we offer a wide range of floral services, including custom arrangements, delivery, and event design. Our goal is to make the process of selecting and arranging flowers as enjoyable and stress-free as possible, so our customers can focus on enjoying their special moments.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Thank you for choosing Tita's Flower Store as your florist. We are honored to be a part of your celebrations and look forward to providing you with the highest level of service and quality. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about our services, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p></p>
